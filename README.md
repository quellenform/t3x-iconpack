# Iconpack

TYPO3 CMS Extension `iconpack`

The most flexible icon system for TYPO3 10, 11, 12 and 13!

---

This extension provides an iconpack registry for custom iconpacks which can be
used in backend and frontend and are rendered according to the configuration of
the installed iconpacks.

The idea behind the extension is to provide a flexible system by means of which
any icon sets can be used and the desired output can be generated at any time by
separating storage and rendering.

## Features

The extension `iconpack` is different from previous implementations and will
probably be the only icon extension you will need in the future.

The biggest differences are among others:

- Not limited to a specific iconset! Existing iconpacks can be installed, or
  custom iconpacks can be created, depending on your requirements
- Easy to use: Install, add the provided TypoScript-template & use it, no
  further configuration needed (but possible!)
- Offers the use of various icons in the header, page, in the bodytext (CKEditor
  4/5) and in your own fields
- All required assets (JavaScripts, StyleSheets, etc.) are automatically added
  in frontend and backend by default, depending on the configuration of the icon
  set used
- All settings of an iconpack can be overridden via an individual configuration
  (YAML)
- Individual iconsets can be easily added (see
  [instructions](https://docs.typo3.org/p/quellenform/t3x-iconpack/main/en-us/Tutorials/CustomIconpack.html)
  for creating your own iconpack provider)
- Can also be integrated into own extensions via the provided form wizard
- Multilingual labels for icons
- Uses the backend caching integrated in TYPO3 for the configuration of the
  installed iconpacks in order not to slow down the backend
- The frontend rendering of icons can be changed afterwards (easily switch from
  Webfont to SVG with TypoScript)
- Works with [Bootstrap
  Package](https://github.com/benjaminkott/bootstrap_package/) and other
  extensions
- No dependency on other extensions or third-party code!


## Planned Features

- Enable the use of SVG sprites in CKEditor 5
- Add contextmenu in CKEditor to edit a previously added icon (and options)
- Optimize the UI/Modal
- Add more detailed information on using and creating your own iconpacks

## How does it work?

Instead of storing the entire HTML markup or a static file path for an icon in
the database fields, a short configuration string is stored instead (also in the
RTE). This string is called "iconfig" and looks something like
`fa6:solid,star,transform:spin`. This example will render the icon *Star* from
the iconpack *Font Awesome 6* (solid style) with the additional property of a
spinning rotation.

This string is only converted into HTML code according to the configuration
during rendering in the backend or frontend, which ensures the greatest possible
flexibility. It is possible to choose whether the icons are to be rendered as a
web font, sprites, inline SVG or as an SVG image without having to change the
content in the database.

Furthermore, this extension adds additional icon fields for pages and text
headers, but it can also be used to extend fields of your own extensions.

> Note: This extension does **NOT** have the same approach as the TYPO3
  integrated `IconRegistry` with its approach to cache all icons including their
  HTML markup for the backend and consider them as absolute, but focuses on
  **handling icons for editors and frontend output**!
